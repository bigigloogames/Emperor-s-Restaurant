**Emperor's Restaurant** is a small idle/management game about running a cute penguin restaurant. It's made with **Godot Engine**, with models created in **Blender** and textures/art done in **Krita** and **Inkscape**. Music was composed using **Online Sequencer**.

The goal is simple: serve food, earn money, upgrade your restaurant, and grow your penguin empire.

## About the Game

You manage a restaurant staffed by penguins. Customers come in, you earn coins, and you use those to improve your setup. The game focuses on relaxed idle gameplay with light strategy and progression.

This project is still a work in progress and is mainly a learning/passion project.
